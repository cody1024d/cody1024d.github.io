This will be a short one, just to try and get myself in the habit again...

So, I didn't do a great job of keeping up with this.  Like, at all.  I'm hoping to start it up again.  Mostly as a way to keep myself "honest" with my learning of Machine Learning, and devops on the server side.  I bought a neat .dev domain, and will be getting a DO droplet, and working through the configuration of all of that.

Oh, and on Machine Learning. I went to IO19, and it seems to be the hot thing.  I don't want to end up like the Dodo Bird, and so, I will be learning machine learning.....or trying to atleast.  It's a little daunting; but I mean, everything is when you first start it.
