This is the first post, of hopefully many in this blog.  I'm hoping to use this to wax philosophical, and describe some of my
thoughts on software engineering in a more concrete form.

I've always had difficulty in getting what's in my robot-head out in some way.  One of my goals is to potentially help myself with this,
forcing myself to describe things in a way that doesn't sound utterly ridiculous.  I'm not totally convinced that I'll be able to accomplish
this, or even be able to continue this, long term, but I'm going to try and make a habit of it.

We'll see.
