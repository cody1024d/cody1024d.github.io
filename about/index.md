This is a work in progress.

This is the part where people normally post about how accomplished they are, or something, right?  A subtle brag about the places I've worked,
the frameworks/libraries I've created, etc.

Really though, the only thing *about* me, that, as a reader you should know, is that I'm still learning.  In every single facet of my life, I'm still learning.
I'm hoping for this to be just another experience that I can grow from.
